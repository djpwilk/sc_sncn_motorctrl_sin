\section test_homing

This test application illustrates the implemtation of homing method based on limit 
switches and a home switch. In this application we have home switch on port 0 of GPIO D 
and positive limit switch on port 1 of GPIO D. Here we use velocity controller to search
 for the home switch and reset the position counters with offset found. 

The main application runs 6 threads in total. 2 of these threads are PWM Server and 
Commutation Server responsible for modulation and motor drive. 

Other 2 threads used for position information are Hall Server thread required for 
BLDC motor commutation  and QEI Server thread for high precision position information. 
A watchdog server is used to monitor CORE 3 and disable motor in case of emergency. 
A GPIO Server to monitor the input switches.

All these 6 threads run on CORE 3 which has physical connection to the interface module (IFM). 

Velocity Control Loop runs on CORE 2/1/0. Another thread for homing runs on core 0/1/2 
which monitors the home and limit switches; and upon encountering the home switch, it 
stores the position, stops the motor and updates the position counter with the offset 
from stop position.

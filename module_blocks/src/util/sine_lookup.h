/** \brief Look up the fixed point sine value
 *
 * This looks up the sine of a value. The value is the index into the
 * sine table, rather than a particular angular measurement. The sine
 * table has 256 entries, so each index is 1.4 degrees.
 *
 * A table of 256 entries is suitable for an encoder angle measured in
 * 1024 steps, attached to a 4 pole motor. Each encoder step is
 * 360/1024 = 0.35 physical degrees, but this is worth 4 times as many
 * electrical degrees, or 1.4 electrical degrees.
 *
 * The result is in fixed point 18.14 format.
